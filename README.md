This is a simple POC for what a blockchain written in Java language.

A blockchain is a chain of blocks, or datastructures, that are put together with specific rules. 
These rules ensure the integrity of the chain and the blocks and can be used in a multitude of applications using transactions
for value exchange and recording. One of its biggest and most famous applications is the Bitcoin Cryptocurrency.

A block is a datastructure that contains a specific set of data, and signed by a cyptographic hash in addition to a hash from the 
previous block in the chain. Tamper with the data payload and the hashes change. When the hashes change, the chain loses integrity.
